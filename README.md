# Phase based disease spread model for SARS-CoV-2 virus

A disease spread simulation based on the paper titled *“A mathematical model forsimulating the phase-basedtransmissibility of a novelcoronavirus” by Tian-Mu Chen et.al.* The simulation has been done in python and is using a system of ODEs(Ordinary Differential Equations) to solve for the disease spread trend from phase to phase. The simulation was done for a period of 120 days. The model correctly predicts the trend if a pre-fit assumption of the initial values are available.
